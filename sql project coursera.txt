Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table =          10000
ii. Business table =          10000
iii. Category table =         10000
iv. Checkin table =           10000
v. elite_years table =        10000
vi. friend table =            10000
vii. hours table =            10000
viii. photo table =           10000
ix. review table =            10000
x. tip table =                10000 
xi. user table =              10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business =     10000 primary key:id
ii. Hours =       1562 foreign key:business_id
iii. Category =   2643 foreign key:business_id
iv. Attribute =   1115 business_id
v. Review =       10000 (id) , 8090 (business_id) , 9581 (user_id)
vi. Checkin =     493 business_id
vii. Photo =      10000 (id) , 6493(photo)
viii. Tip =       537 (user_id) , 3979(business_id)
ix. User =        10000 (id)
x. Friend =       11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

I pick "toronto" and Restaurants as category
in my choices have not different distribution of hour 
The place with higher rating stars(4.5) open late on
Saturday. 

+---------+-------+-------------+----------------------+
| city    | stars | category    | hours                |

| Toronto |   4.5 | Restaurants | Saturday|16:00-2:00  |
+---------+-------+-------------+----------------------+


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

The group with 2.0 stars has 5 review comared with the group with 4.0 rating star.


+---------+-------+-------------+----------------------+--------------+
| city    | stars | category    | hours                | review_count |
+---------+-------+-------------+----------------------+--------------+

| Toronto |   3.0 | Restaurants | Saturday|10:00-4:00  |           34 |
| Toronto |   4.0 | Restaurants | Saturday|18:00-23:00 |           89 |
| Toronto |   4.5 | Restaurants | Saturday|16:00-2:00  |           26 |
+---------+-------+-------------+----------------------+--------------+
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

no  
+---------+-------+-------------+----------------------+--------------+-----------------------+
| city    | stars | category    | hours                | review_count | address               |

+---------+-------+-------------+----------------------+--------------+-----------------------+

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT city , stars , category , hours
FROM (category c INNER JOIN business b ON b.id=c.business_id)
INNER JOIN  hours ON b.id=hours.business_id
WHERE city='Toronto' AND category='Restaurants'
GROUP BY stars

SELECT city , stars , category , hours , review_count
FROM (category c INNER JOIN business b ON b.id=c.business_id)
INNER JOIN  hours ON b.id=hours.business_id
WHERE city='Toronto' AND category='Restaurants'
GROUP BY stars 
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:The ones that are still open have more reviews.
While the average of the star ranking is almost constant

+-----------+---------------+----------------+--------------+---------+
| city      |    AVG(stars) | category       | review_count | is_open |
+-----------+---------------+----------------+--------------+---------+
| Las Vegas | 3.66393442623 | Japanese       |            3 |       0 |
| Westlake  | 3.89982578397 | American (New) |          105 |       1 |
+-----------+---------------+----------------+--------------+---------+
         
         
ii. Difference 2:There are more business that are still open listed as
"cool".
         
+-------+--------------+---------+-------------+
| stars | review_count | is_open | COUNT(cool) |
+-------+--------------+---------+-------------+
|   3.5 |          138 |       0 |          71 |
|   2.0 |           12 |       1 |         565 |
+-------+--------------+---------+-------------+
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT city , AVG(stars) , category , review_count ,is_open
FROM category c INNER JOIN business b ON b.id=c.business_id
GROUP BY is_open
	

SELECT  b.stars , review_count ,is_open , COUNT(cool)
FROM review INNER JOIN business b ON b.id=review.business_id
GROUP BY is_open
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
 I chose food popularity  on yelp
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
     I pick several types of food including
'Restaurants', 'Coffee & Tea', 'Sandwiches' , 'Pizza', 'Burgers', 'Fast Food','Food'
Then I analyze their average star ratings and number of
Restaurants so that I can get some insights on which type of food is
popular.                      
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
+-------------+---------------+--------------+--------+
| city        |    AVG(stars) | category     | NUMBER |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+--------+
| Mississauga |         3.125 | Burgers      |      8 |
| Cleveland   | 3.83333333333 | Coffee & Tea |      3 |
| Verdun      | 3.21428571429 | Fast Food    |      7 |
| Toronto     | 3.78260869565 | Food         |     23 |
| Pittsburgh  |         3.375 | Pizza        |      4 |
| Toronto     | 3.45774647887 | Restaurants  |     71 |
| Cleveland   |        3.9375 | Sandwiches   |      8 |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+--------+

iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SELECT  city , AVG(stars) , category , COUNT(name) AS NUMBER
FROM business LEFT JOIN category ON business.id=category.business_id
WHERE category IN ('Restaurants', 'Coffee & Tea', 'Sandwiches' , 'Pizza', 'Burgers', 'Fast Food','Food')
GROUP BY category
